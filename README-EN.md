# ChoTenChat

[中文 README 在这里](README.md)

ChoTenChat is a chat plugin that runs on the Minecraft Bukkit platform.

A powerful Minecraft chat plugin that can create groups and friends on multiple servers under the Taboolib architecture.

Our goal is to achieve almost the same functionality as "the largest social media app in China" in MC.

Based on<a ref="https://tabooproject.org"> Taboolib 6.x </a>and Kotlin

At present, we only support Bukkit (Redis cross server), but support for Bungee and Velocity is planned after the completion of the ontology plugin.

**This project is still under construction, please be patient or submit a PR**

The name of this project comes from：
<div style="text-align: center;">Character named ChoTen-Chan In Game <a href = "https://needystreameroverload.wiki.gg/wiki/">Needy Girl Overdose</a> </div>
